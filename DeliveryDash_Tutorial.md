---

## **Section 2: Introducing Methods**
*Duration: ~15 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Understand what methods are and why they're useful
- Learn about Unity's built-in methods (Start, Update)
- Create your first script

### Conceptual Overview

**What is a Method?**
A method is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Think of it like a recipe - it's a set of instructions that can be followed whenever needed.

**Unity's Special Methods:**
- `Start()` - Runs once when the game starts
- `Update()` - Runs every frame (60+ times per second)

### Steps

1. **Create the Driver Script**
   - Right-click in Scripts folder
   - Create → C# Script
   - Name: "Driver"
   - Double-click to open in your code editor

2. **Understand the Default Code**
   ```csharp
   using UnityEngine;
   
   public class Driver : MonoBehaviour
   {
       // Start is called before the first frame update
       void Start()
       {
           
       }
   
       // Update is called once per frame
       void Update()
       {
           
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Add Debug Messages**
   ```csharp
   void Start()
   {
       Debug.Log("Game has started!");
   }
   
   void Update()
   {
       Debug.Log("Update is running...");
   }
   ```

4. **Test Your Script**
   - Create empty GameObject: GameObject → Create Empty
   - Name it "Car"
   - Add Driver script: drag script onto Car in Inspector
   - Click Play
   - Open Console window: Window → General → Console
   - Observe the messages (Stop after a few seconds!)

5. **Clean Up**
   - Comment out or delete the Debug.Log in Update (it's too frequent!)
   - Keep the one in Start

**💡 Key Takeaway**: Methods organize our code into logical chunks. Start() runs once for initialization, Update() runs continuously for frame-by-frame logic.

---

## **Section 3: Transform.Translate()**
*Duration: ~8 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the Transform component
- Learn how to move objects in 2D space
- Practice using Unity's coordinate system

### Conceptual Overview

**Transform Component**: Every GameObject has a Transform that stores its position, rotation, and scale.

**Translate()**: Moves an object by adding to its current position.
- `Translate(x, y, z)` in 2D, we use x and y
- Positive Y = up, Negative Y = down
- Positive X = right, Negative X = left

### Steps

1. **Add Movement Code**
   ```csharp
   void Update()
   {
       transform.Translate(0, 0.01f, 0);
   }
   ```

2. **Test Movement**
   - Click Play
   - Watch your Car move upward
   - Notice it moves in Scene view and Game view

3. **Experiment with Different Values**
   ```csharp
   // Move right
   transform.Translate(0.01f, 0, 0);
   
   // Move diagonally
   transform.Translate(0.01f, 0.01f, 0);
   
   // Move down
   transform.Translate(0, -0.01f, 0);
   ```

4. **Understanding the Numbers**
   - The third parameter (z) is 0 in 2D games
   - Larger values = faster movement
   - Small values (0.01f) because Update runs ~60 times/second

**💡 Key Takeaway**: Transform.Translate() moves objects relative to their current position. The 'f' after numbers means "float" (decimal number).

---

## **Section 4: Introducing Variables**
*Duration: ~10 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Understand what variables are and their purpose
- Learn about different variable types
- Practice declaring and using variables

### Conceptual Overview

**What is a Variable?**
A variable is a named container for storing data. Think of it like a labeled box where you can put values.

**Common Types:**
- `int` - Whole numbers (5, 100, -42)
- `float` - Decimal numbers (5.5f, 3.14f)
- `bool` - True or false
- `string` - Text ("Hello")

### Steps

1. **Declare a Speed Variable**
   ```csharp
   public class Driver : MonoBehaviour
   {
       float moveSpeed = 0.01f;
       
       void Update()
       {
           transform.Translate(0, moveSpeed, 0);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Test with Different Values**
   - Change `moveSpeed = 0.02f;`
   - Play and observe faster movement
   - Try `0.001f` for slower movement

3. **Add More Variables**
   ```csharp
   float moveSpeed = 0.01f;
   float turnSpeed = 0.1f;
   int numberOfDeliveries = 0;
   bool hasPackage = false;
   ```

4. **Understanding Variable Naming**
   - Use camelCase: `moveSpeed`, `turnSpeed`
   - Be descriptive: `speed` is okay, but `playerMovementSpeed` is better
   - No spaces allowed: `move speed` ❌ | `moveSpeed` ✅

**💡 Key Takeaway**: Variables make code flexible and maintainable. Instead of hardcoding values, store them in variables you can easily change.

## **Section 5: Using SerializeField**
*Duration: ~8 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Understand public vs private variables
- Learn to expose variables in the Inspector
- Practice adjusting values without recompiling

### Conceptual Overview

**Access Modifiers:**
- `public` - Visible everywhere, including Inspector
- `private` - Only visible within the script (default)

**[SerializeField]**: Makes private variables visible in Inspector while keeping them private in code (best practice).

### Steps

1. **Compare Public and Private**
   ```csharp
   public float moveSpeed = 0.01f;      // Visible in Inspector
   private float turnSpeed = 0.1f;      // Hidden in Inspector
   float rotationSpeed = 50f;           // Also private (default)
   ```

2. **Test in Unity**
   - Select Car GameObject
   - See moveSpeed in Inspector
   - turnSpeed and rotationSpeed are hidden

3. **Use SerializeField (Best Practice)**
   ```csharp
   [SerializeField] float moveSpeed = 0.01f;
   [SerializeField] float turnSpeed = 0.1f;
   [SerializeField] float rotationSpeed = 50f;
   ```

4. **Benefits of SerializeField**
   - Variables visible in Inspector for easy tuning
   - Still private (can't be accessed by other scripts accidentally)
   - Values persist between play sessions
   - Can adjust while game is running (for testing)

5. **Organize Your Variables**
   ```csharp
   public class Driver : MonoBehaviour
   {
       [Header("Movement Settings")]
       [SerializeField] float currentSpeed = 5f;
       [SerializeField] float steerSpeed = 200f;
       
       [Header("Speed Variations")]
       [SerializeField] float boostSpeed = 10f;
       [SerializeField] float regularSpeed = 5f;
       
       void Update()
       {
           transform.Translate(0, currentSpeed * Time.deltaTime, 0);
       }
   }
   ```

**💡 Key Takeaway**: Use [SerializeField] for values you want to adjust in the Inspector while keeping proper encapsulation. It's the Unity best practice!

## **Section 6: Keyboard Input & If Statements**
*Duration: ~12 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Handle keyboard input using Unity's Input System
- Use conditional statements (if/else)
- Implement basic player control

### Conceptual Overview

**Conditional Statements**: Execute code only when certain conditions are true.

**Unity Input System**: The modern way to handle player input in Unity.

### Steps

1. **Install Input System Package**
   - Window → Package Manager
   - Switch to "Unity Registry"
   - Find "Input System"
   - Click "Install"
   - Allow Unity to restart

2. **Set Up Input System**
   - Add to Driver.cs:
   ```csharp
   using UnityEngine.InputSystem;
   ```

3. **Detect Single Key Press**
   ```csharp
   void Update()
   {
       if (Keyboard.current.wKey.isPressed)
       {
           Debug.Log("W key is pressed!");
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Multiple Keys with If-Else**
   ```csharp
   void Update()
   {
       if (Keyboard.current.wKey.isPressed)
       {
           Debug.Log("Moving forward");
           transform.Translate(0, 0.1f, 0);
       }
       else if (Keyboard.current.sKey.isPressed)
       {
           Debug.Log("Moving backward");
           transform.Translate(0, -0.1f, 0);
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Add Rotation Input**
   ```csharp
   void Update()
   {
       // Forward/Backward
       if (Keyboard.current.wKey.isPressed)
       {
           transform.Translate(0, 0.1f, 0);
       }
       else if (Keyboard.current.sKey.isPressed)
       {
           transform.Translate(0, -0.1f, 0);
       }
       
       // Left/Right Rotation
       if (Keyboard.current.aKey.isPressed)
       {
           transform.Rotate(0, 0, 1f);
       }
       else if (Keyboard.current.dKey.isPressed)
       {
           transform.Rotate(0, 0, -1f);
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Using Variables for Input**
   ```csharp
   void Update()
   {
       float move = 0f;
       float steer = 0f;
       
       if (Keyboard.current.wKey.isPressed)
           move = 1f;
       else if (Keyboard.current.sKey.isPressed)
           move = -1f;
           
       if (Keyboard.current.aKey.isPressed)
           steer = 1f;
       else if (Keyboard.current.dKey.isPressed)
           steer = -1f;
   }
   ```

**💡 Key Takeaway**: If statements let us execute code conditionally. The Input System provides a modern, flexible way to handle player input.

## **Section 7: Moving Our Car**
*Duration: ~10 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Combine movement and rotation
- Use variables to control speed
- Implement smooth car controls

### Steps

1. **Clean Movement System**
   ```csharp
   [SerializeField] float moveSpeed = 5f;
   [SerializeField] float steerSpeed = 200f;
   
   void Update()
   {
       float move = 0f;
       float steer = 0f;
       
       // Get input
       if (Keyboard.current.wKey.isPressed)
           move = 1f;
       else if (Keyboard.current.sKey.isPressed)
           move = -1f;
           
       if (Keyboard.current.aKey.isPressed)
           steer = 1f;
       else if (Keyboard.current.dKey.isPressed)
           steer = -1f;
       
       // Apply movement
       float moveAmount = move * moveSpeed;
       float steerAmount = steer * steerSpeed;
       
       transform.Translate(0, moveAmount, 0);
       transform.Rotate(0, 0, steerAmount);
   }
   ```

2. **Test and Tune**
   - Play the game
   - Adjust moveSpeed in Inspector (try 3-8)
   - Adjust steerSpeed in Inspector (try 100-300)

3. **Understanding the Formula**
   - `move` is -1, 0, or 1
   - Multiply by speed to get actual movement
   - This pattern is standard in game development

**💡 Key Takeaway**: Separating input detection from movement application makes code cleaner and easier to tune.

---

## **Section 8: Using Time.deltaTime**
*Duration: ~8 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Understand frame-rate independence
- Learn why Time.deltaTime is crucial
- Implement smooth, consistent movement

### Conceptual Overview

**The Problem**: Update() runs at different speeds on different computers
- Fast PC: 144 FPS → 144 movements/second
- Slow PC: 30 FPS → 30 movements/second
- Result: Inconsistent game speed!

**The Solution**: Time.deltaTime
- Time since last frame (in seconds)
- ~0.016 seconds at 60 FPS
- ~0.007 seconds at 144 FPS
- Multiply movement by this to normalize

### Steps

1. **Add Time.deltaTime**
   ```csharp
   void Update()
   {
       float move = 0f;
       float steer = 0f;
       
       if (Keyboard.current.wKey.isPressed)
           move = 1f;
       else if (Keyboard.current.sKey.isPressed)
           move = -1f;
           
       if (Keyboard.current.aKey.isPressed)
           steer = 1f;
       else if (Keyboard.current.dKey.isPressed)
           steer = -1f;
       
       // TIME.DELTATIME ADDED HERE!
       float moveAmount = move * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
       float steerAmount = steer * steerSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
       
       transform.Translate(0, moveAmount, 0);
       transform.Rotate(0, 0, steerAmount);
   }
   ```

2. **Adjust Speed Values**
   - Because we're multiplying by a small number (~0.016), we need bigger speeds
   - Change moveSpeed to 5-10
   - Change steerSpeed to 200-300

3. **Test Frame Rate Independence**
   - Play game
   - Movement should feel smooth
   - Speed is now in "units per second" rather than "units per frame"

**💡 Key Takeaway**: ALWAYS multiply movement by Time.deltaTime for frame-rate independent games. This is a fundamental Unity principle!

## **Section 9: Colliders & Rigidbodies**
*Duration: ~10 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Understand Unity's physics system
- Add Colliders for collision detection
- Use Rigidbody2D for physics simulation

### Conceptual Overview

**Colliders**: Invisible shapes that define object boundaries
- BoxCollider2D - Rectangles
- CircleCollider2D - Circles
- PolygonCollider2D - Custom shapes

**Rigidbody2D**: Applies physics (gravity, forces, collisions)
- Dynamic - Full physics
- Kinematic - Controllable, but affected by collisions
- Static - Doesn't move

### Steps

1. **Add Sprite to Car**
   - Find or create a simple car sprite (rectangle for now)
   - Select Car GameObject
   - Add Component → Sprite Renderer
   - Drag sprite into Sprite field
   - Set Order in Layer: 1

2. **Add Collider**
   - With Car selected
   - Add Component → Box Collider 2D
   - You'll see green outline in Scene view
   - Adjust size to match sprite

3. **Add Rigidbody2D**
   - Add Component → Rigidbody 2D
   - Set Body Type: Kinematic (we control movement, not physics)
   - Set Gravity Scale: 0 (no gravity in this game)
   - Check "Freeze Rotation Z" (prevent spinning on collision)

4. **Create Ground/Obstacle**
   - GameObject → 2D Object → Sprite → Square
   - Name: "Wall"
   - Position it in front of the car
   - Add Component → Box Collider 2D

5. **Test Collision**
   - Play game
   - Drive into the wall
   - Car should stop (physical collision detected)

6. **Rigidbody2D Settings Explained**
   ```
   Body Type:
   - Dynamic: Full physics, affected by forces/gravity
   - Kinematic: Script-controlled, but can collide
   - Static: Never moves (for walls, ground)
   
   Constraints:
   - Freeze Position: Prevent movement on axis
   - Freeze Rotation: Prevent spinning
   ```

**💡 Key Takeaway**: Colliders define "where" an object is, Rigidbody2D defines "how" it behaves physically. Together they enable collision detection.

---

## **Section 10: Using OnCollisionEnter2D()**
*Duration: ~8 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Detect collision events in code
- Respond to different collision types
- Understand Unity's collision callbacks

### Conceptual Overview

**Collision Callbacks**: Methods Unity automatically calls when collisions occur
- `OnCollisionEnter2D()` - When collision starts
- `OnCollisionStay2D()` - While colliding
- `OnCollisionExit2D()` - When collision ends

**Requirements for Collision**:
- Both objects have Colliders
- At least one has a Rigidbody2D
- Neither collider is set to "Trigger"

### Steps

1. **Add Collision Detection**
   ```csharp
   void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)
   {
       Debug.Log("Collision detected with: " + collision.gameObject.name);
   }
   ```

2. **Create Different Obstacles**
   - Create several Square sprites
   - Name them: "Wall", "Rock", "Tree"
   - Add BoxCollider2D to each
   - Position them around the scene

3. **Test Collision**
   - Play game
   - Drive into obstacles
   - Check Console for collision messages

4. **Respond to Specific Collisions**
   ```csharp
   void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)
   {
       if (collision.gameObject.name == "Wall")
       {
           Debug.Log("Hit a wall!");
           // Could add damage, sound effect, etc.
       }
       else if (collision.gameObject.name == "Rock")
       {
           Debug.Log("Hit a rock!");
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Slow Down on Collision**
   ```csharp
   [SerializeField] float currentSpeed = 5f;
   [SerializeField] float regularSpeed = 5f;
   [SerializeField] float slowSpeed = 2f;
   
   void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)
   {
       Debug.Log("Bumped into something!");
       currentSpeed = slowSpeed;
   }
   ```

   Update Update() method:
   ```csharp
   float moveAmount = move * currentSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
   ```

**💡 Key Takeaway**: OnCollisionEnter2D() lets us respond to physical collisions. Use it for impacts, damage, sound effects, or game state changes.

---

## **Section 11: Using OnTriggerEnter2D()**
*Duration: ~10 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the difference between Collisions and Triggers
- Implement pickup systems
- Create non-blocking interactions

### Conceptual Overview

**Collision vs Trigger**:
- **Collision**: Physical barrier, objects bounce/stop
- **Trigger**: Invisible detection zone, objects pass through

**When to Use Triggers**:
- Pickups (coins, packages)
- Checkpoints
- Detection zones
- Invisible boundaries

### Steps

1. **Create Package GameObject**
   - GameObject → 2D Object → Sprite → Square
   - Name: "Package"
   - Change Sprite color to yellow/gold
   - Scale: (0.5, 0.5, 1)

2. **Add Trigger Collider**
   - Add Component → Box Collider 2D
   - ✅ Check "Is Trigger" box
   - Notice the collider turns green in Scene view

3. **Create Delivery Script**
   - Create new script: "Delivery"
   - Attach to Car GameObject
   ```csharp
   using UnityEngine;
   
   public class Delivery : MonoBehaviour
   {
       void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
       {
           Debug.Log("Triggered by: " + collision.gameObject.name);
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Test Trigger**
   - Play game
   - Drive through the Package
   - Car passes through (no physical collision)
   - Console shows "Triggered by: Package"

5. **Compare Collision vs Trigger**
   Create two test objects:
   ```
   CollisionTest:
   - Box Collider 2D (Is Trigger: OFF)
   
   TriggerTest:
   - Box Collider 2D (Is Trigger: ON)
   ```
   Drive into both and observe the difference.

6. **Implement Package Pickup**
   ```csharp
   void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
   {
       if (collision.gameObject.name == "Package")
       {
           Debug.Log("Picked up package!");
           Destroy(collision.gameObject);
       }
   }
   ```

**💡 Key Takeaway**: Triggers detect when objects enter an area without physically blocking them. Perfect for pickups, zones, and sensors!

## **Section 14: Car & Background**
*Duration: ~12 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Apply sprites to GameObjects
- Set up sprite layers
- Create a basic game environment

### Steps

1. **Apply Car Sprite**
   - Select Car GameObject
   - In Sprite Renderer component
   - Drag car sprite into Sprite field
   - Adjust scale if needed: (1, 1, 1)

2. **Create Background**
   - GameObject → 2D Object → Sprite → Square
   - Name: "Background"
   - Position: (0, 0, 0)
   - Scale: (20, 20, 1)
   - Sprite Renderer → Sprite: Grass/road texture
   - Order in Layer: -10 (behind everything)

3. **Set Up Sprite Layers**
   ```
   -10: Background
   0: Roads, Ground tiles
   1: Obstacles
   2: Pickups
   3: Car
   4: Effects
   5: UI Elements
   ```

4. **Configure Car Sprite Renderer**
   - Select Car
   - Sprite Renderer → Order in Layer: 3
   - This ensures car appears on top

5. **Adjust Collider to Match Sprite**
   - Select Car
   - Box Collider 2D → Edit Collider button
   - Drag edges to match car sprite shape
   - Or adjust Size/Offset values

6. **Test Visual Setup**
   - Play game
   - Car should be clearly visible
   - Movement should feel right for the sprite size
   - Adjust camera orthographic size if needed (Main Camera → Size: 5-10)

## **Section 17: Using Tags In Unity**
*Duration: ~12 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Understand Unity's Tag system
- Create custom tags
- Use tags for object identification

### Conceptual Overview

**Tags**: Labels we attach to GameObjects to identify them in code
- More efficient than comparing names
- Standard way to categorize objects
- Can be used for filtering and searching

### Steps

1. **Create Custom Tags**
   - Any GameObject → Inspector → Tag → Add Tag
   - Click '+' to add new tags:
     - "Package"
     - "Customer"
     - "Boost"
     - "WorldCollision"

2. **Assign Tags to Objects**
   - Select package GameObject
   - Tag dropdown → "Package"
   - Select customer GameObject
   - Tag dropdown → "Customer"

3. **Update Delivery Script to Use Tags**
   ```csharp
   void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
   {
       // OLD WAY (inefficient):
       // if (collision.gameObject.name == "Package")
       
       // NEW WAY (efficient):
       if (collision.CompareTag("Package"))
       {
           Debug.Log("Picked up package!");
           Destroy(collision.gameObject);
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Update Driver Script**
   ```csharp
   void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)
   {
       if (collision.collider.CompareTag("WorldCollision"))
       {
           Debug.Log("Hit a wall!");
           currentSpeed = regularSpeed;
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Benefits of Tags**
   - ✅ Faster than string comparison of names
   - ✅ Typo-safe (autocomplete in IDE)
   - ✅ Can find objects: `GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("Package")`
   - ✅ Easy to categorize and organize

6. **Tag Best Practices**
   - Keep tag names simple and clear
   - Use PascalCase: "Package" not "package"
   - Don't overuse - consider Layers for complex systems
   - Document your tag usage

**💡 Key Takeaway**: Tags are the standard way to identify object types in Unity. Always use `CompareTag()` instead of name comparison!

## **Section 18: Introducing Bools**
*Duration: ~8 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Understand boolean logic
- Implement state tracking
- Use bools for game mechanics

### Conceptual Overview

**Boolean (bool)**: A variable that can only be `true` or `false`
- Perfect for on/off states
- Used in conditionals
- Tracks game state

**Common Uses**:
- Is player grounded?
- Has power-up?
- Is game paused?
- Has key/package?

### Steps

1. **Add Package State Tracking**
   ```csharp
   public class Delivery : MonoBehaviour
   {
       bool hasPackage = false;
       
       void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
       {
           if (collision.CompareTag("Package"))
           {
               Debug.Log("Picked up package!");
               hasPackage = true;
               Destroy(collision.gameObject);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Create Customer Delivery System**
   - GameObject → 2D Object → Sprite → Circle
   - Name: "Customer"
   - Tag: "Customer"
   - Color: Blue
   - Add: Box Collider 2D (Is Trigger: ✅)

3. **Implement Delivery Logic**
   ```csharp
   bool hasPackage = false;
   
   void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
   {
       if (collision.CompareTag("Package") && !hasPackage)
       {
           Debug.Log("Picked up package");
           hasPackage = true;
           Destroy(collision.gameObject);
       }
       
       if (collision.CompareTag("Customer") && hasPackage)
       {
           Debug.Log("Delivered package!");
           hasPackage = false;
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Understanding Boolean Operators**
   ```csharp
   // && = AND (both must be true)
   if (hasPackage && nearCustomer)
   
   // || = OR (at least one must be true)
   if (hasPackage || hasBoost)
   
   // ! = NOT (inverts the value)
   if (!hasPackage)  // same as: if (hasPackage == false)
   ```

5. **Prevent Multiple Pickups**
   ```csharp
   if (collision.CompareTag("Package") && !hasPackage)
   {
       // Will only trigger if we DON'T have a package
       // Prevents picking up multiple packages
       hasPackage = true;
       Destroy(collision.gameObject);
   }
   ```

**💡 Key Takeaway**: Bools are essential for tracking game state. Use them to control what actions are possible at any time.

---

## **Section 19: Introducing Prefabs**
*Duration: ~8 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Understand what Prefabs are
- Create reusable game objects
- Use Prefabs for efficient level design

### Conceptual Overview

**Prefab**: A reusable GameObject template
- Create once, use many times
- Edit one, update all instances
- Essential for game development
- Perfect for: Enemies, pickups, obstacles, projectiles

### Steps

1. **Create Package Prefab**
   - Set up one Package GameObject perfectly:
     - Sprite
     - Collider (Is Trigger: ✅)
     - Tag: "Package"
     - Scale
   - Drag from Hierarchy to Prefabs folder
   - GameObject turns blue (prefab instance)

2. **Create Multiple Instances**
   - Drag Package prefab from Project to Scene
   - Place multiple around your level
   - They're all identical

3. **Edit the Prefab**
   - Double-click Package prefab in Project
   - Enter Prefab Mode
   - Change sprite color to bright yellow
   - Exit Prefab Mode (arrow in Hierarchy)
   - ALL instances update automatically!

4. **Create More Prefabs**
   Create prefabs for:
   - Customer
   - Boost pad
   - Obstacles (rock, tree)
   - Walls/barriers

5. **Override Instance Properties**
   - Select one Package instance
   - Change its position/scale
   - Inspector shows "Overrides"
   - Can revert to prefab defaults

6. **Prefab Best Practices**
   ```
   Good Prefab Structure:
   Package (Parent)
   ├── Sprite
   ├── Collider
   ├── Particle Effect
   └── Script
   
   Name: "Package_Prefab"
   Location: Prefabs/Items/
   ```

**💡 Key Takeaway**: Prefabs are crucial for workflow efficiency. Set up objects once, reuse everywhere, edit in one place!

## **Section 20: How To Destroy Objects**
*Duration: ~10 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Use Destroy() function
- Understand delayed destruction
- Manage object lifecycle

### Conceptual Overview

**Destroy()**: Removes GameObjects from the scene
- Immediate or delayed
- Affects entire GameObject and children
- Can destroy specific components

**Syntax**: `Destroy(what, optionalDelay)`

### Steps

1. **Immediate Destruction**
   ```csharp
   void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
   {
       if (collision.CompareTag("Package"))
       {
           Debug.Log("Package collected!");
           Destroy(collision.gameObject);  // Destroyed immediately
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Delayed Destruction**
   ```csharp
   [SerializeField] float destroyDelay = 0.5f;
   
   void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
   {
       if (collision.CompareTag("Package"))
       {
           Debug.Log("Package collected!");
           Destroy(collision.gameObject, destroyDelay);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Why Use Delay?**
   - Play pickup animation
   - Show particle effects
   - Fade out audio
   - Smoother visual feedback

4. **Destroy Customer After Delivery**
   ```csharp
   if (collision.CompareTag("Customer") && hasPackage)
   {
       Debug.Log("Package delivered!");
       hasPackage = false;
       Destroy(collision.gameObject);  // Customer satisfied, removed
   }
   ```

5. **Destroy Component vs GameObject**
   ```csharp
   // Destroy entire GameObject
   Destroy(gameObject);
   
   // Destroy specific component
   Destroy(GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>());
   
   // Destroy this script
   Destroy(this);
   ```

6. **Common Mistake: Destroying Too Early**
   ```csharp
   // WRONG - Destroys before delay ends
   Destroy(gameObject, 2f);
   Debug.Log("This won't print!");  // Script destroyed!
   
   // RIGHT - Use Invoke for delayed code
   Destroy(gameObject, 2f);
   ```

7. **Safety Check Before Destruction**
   ```csharp
   void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
   {
       if (collision != null && collision.gameObject != null)
       {
           if (collision.CompareTag("Package"))
           {
               Destroy(collision.gameObject, destroyDelay);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

**💡 Key Takeaway**: Destroy() removes objects from memory. Use delays for better visual feedback, but be careful about destroying objects that still need to run code!

---

## **Section 21: Using GetComponent**
*Duration: ~10 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Access other components via code
- Understand component-based architecture
- Control particle systems, sounds, etc.

### Conceptual Overview

**GetComponent**: Retrieves a component attached to a GameObject
- Unity is component-based (not inheritance)
- Each component adds functionality
- Scripts communicate through components

**Syntax**: `GetComponent<ComponentType>()`

### Steps

1. **Add Particle System**
   - Select Car GameObject
   - Add Component → Effects → Particle System
   - Configure particle system:
     ```
     Duration: 1
     Looping: ✅
     Start Lifetime: 0.5
     Start Speed: 2
     Start Size: 0.2
     Emission Rate: 10
     Shape: Cone
     ```
   - Stop it: Click "Stop" in Play mode or uncheck at start

2. **Control Particles from Script**
   ```csharp
   void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
   {
       if (collision.CompareTag("Package") && !hasPackage)
       {
           Debug.Log("Picked up package");
           hasPackage = true;
           
           // Play particle effect
           GetComponent<ParticleSystem>().Play();
           
           Destroy(collision.gameObject);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Stop Particles on Delivery**
   ```csharp
   if (collision.CompareTag("Customer") && hasPackage)
   {
       Debug.Log("Delivered package!");
       hasPackage = false;
       
       // Stop particle effect
       GetComponent<ParticleSystem>().Stop();
       
       Destroy(collision.gameObject);
   }
   ```

4. **Cache Component Reference (Optimization)**
   ```csharp
   // Inefficient - GetComponent every frame/trigger
   GetComponent<ParticleSystem>().Play();
   
   // Efficient - Get once, store, reuse
   ParticleSystem packageParticles;
   
   void Start()
   {
       packageParticles = GetComponent<ParticleSystem>();
   }
   
   void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
   {
       if (collision.CompareTag("Package"))
       {
           packageParticles.Play();  // Use cached reference
       }
   }
   ```

5. **GetComponent on Other Objects**
   ```csharp
   void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
   {
       // Get component from colliding object
       SpriteRenderer sr = collision.GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>();
       if (sr != null)
       {
           sr.color = Color.red;  // Change color of hit object
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Common Components to GetComponent**
   ```csharp
   // Transform (position, rotation, scale)
   Transform myTransform = GetComponent<Transform>();
   // Or just use: transform (lowercase, built-in)
   
   // Rigidbody2D (physics)
   Rigidbody2D rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
   
   // Sprite Renderer (visuals)
   SpriteRenderer sr = GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>();
   
   // Collider
   BoxCollider2D collider = GetComponent<BoxCollider2D>();
   
   // Audio Source
   AudioSource audio = GetComponent<AudioSource>();
   
   // Your custom scripts
   Driver driverScript = GetComponent<Driver>();
   ```

**💡 Key Takeaway**: GetComponent is how scripts interact with other components. Cache references in Start() for better performance!

           float move = 0f;
           float steer = 0f;
           
           if (Keyboard.current.wKey.isPressed)
               move = 1f;
           else if (Keyboard.current.sKey.isPressed)
               move = -1f;
               
           if (Keyboard.current.aKey.isPressed)
               steer = 1f;
           else if (Keyboard.current.dKey.isPressed)
               steer = -1f;
           
           float moveAmount = move * currentSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
           float steerAmount = steer * steerSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
           
           transform.Translate(0, moveAmount, 0);
           transform.Rotate(0, 0, steerAmount);
       }
       
       void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)

   void UpdateScoreUI()
   {
       scoreText.text = "Score: " + score;
   }
   
   // In Delivery.cs
   void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
   {
       if (collision.CompareTag("Customer") && hasPackage)
       {
           score += 100;
           UpdateScoreUI();
       }
   }
   ```

**💡 Key Takeaway**: TextMeshPro provides high-quality, performant UI text. Always use TMP instead of legacy UI Text!

## **Section 24: Complete Delivery System**
*Duration: ~15 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Finalize package pickup/delivery system
- Add visual feedback
- Polish gameplay loop

### Steps

1. **Final Delivery Script**
   ```csharp
   using UnityEngine;
   
   public class Delivery : MonoBehaviour
   {
       [Header("Package Settings")]
       [SerializeField] bool hasPackage = false;
       [SerializeField] float destroyDelay = 0.5f;
       [SerializeField] Color packageColor = Color.yellow;
       [SerializeField] Color normalColor = Color.white;
       
       SpriteRenderer spriteRenderer;
       ParticleSystem packageParticles;
       
       void Start()
       {
           spriteRenderer = GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>();
           packageParticles = GetComponent<ParticleSystem>();
       }
       
       void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
       {
           // Pick up package
           if (collision.CompareTag("Package") && !hasPackage)
           {
               Debug.Log("Picked up package");
               hasPackage = true;
               spriteRenderer.color = packageColor;
               packageParticles.Play();
               Destroy(collision.gameObject, destroyDelay);
           }
           
           // Deliver to customer
           if (collision.CompareTag("Customer") && hasPackage)
           {
               Debug.Log("Delivered package!");
               hasPackage = false;
               spriteRenderer.color = normalColor;
               packageParticles.Stop();
               Destroy(collision.gameObject);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Add Particle Effects**
   - Select Car
   - Configure Particle System:
     ```
     Main Module:
     - Start Color: Yellow (for package)
     - Start Size: 0.3
     - Start Speed: 1
     - Start Lifetime: 1
     
     Emission:
     - Rate over Time: 20
     
     Shape:
     - Shape: Circle
     - Radius: 0.5
     ```

3. **Color Feedback System**
   - Car changes color when carrying package
   - Helps player know current state
   - Visual = intuitive gameplay

4. **Create Multiple Delivery Routes**
   - Place 3-5 Package/Customer pairs
   - Customer positions marked clearly
   - Packages spread around map

5. **Test Complete Loop**
   1. Drive to package (trigger enters)
   2. Package destroyed after delay
   3. Car color changes
   4. Particles activate
   5. Drive to customer
   6. Customer destroyed
   7. Car returns to normal
   8. Ready for next delivery

**💡 Key Takeaway**: Complete game loops with clear feedback create satisfying gameplay. Players should always know their current state and objectives.

## **Section 25: Polish & Optimization**
*Duration: ~20 minutes*

### Learning Objectives
- Add audio feedback
- Optimize performance
- Final polish pass

### Steps

1. **Add Sound Effects**
   - Import audio files:
     - Engine sound (looping)
     - Pickup sound
     - Delivery sound
     - Collision sound
     - Boost sound

2. **Configure Audio**
   ```csharp
   [Header("Audio")]
   [SerializeField] AudioSource engineSound;
   [SerializeField] AudioClip pickupSound;
   [SerializeField] AudioClip deliverySound;
   [SerializeField] AudioClip collisionSound;
   
   void Start()
   {
       engineSound.Play();  // Loop engine sound
   }
   
   void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
   {
       if (collision.CompareTag("Package"))
       {
           AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(pickupSound, transform.position);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use object pooling for frequently spawned objects
   - Combine sprites into atlas
   - Use Composite Collider for tilemaps
   - Cache GetComponent calls
   - Disable particle systems when off-screen

4. **Visual Polish**
   - Add dust particles when driving
   - Screen shake on collision
   - Camera smoothing adjustments
   - Better sprite animations (optional)

5. **Gameplay Tuning**
   - Test all speed values
   - Ensure level is beatable
   - Balance difficulty curve
   - Add checkpoints (optional)

**💡 Key Takeaway**: Polish separates good games from great games. Small details (sounds, particles, feedback) create professional feel.
